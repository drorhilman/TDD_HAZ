,"The worms appear suddenly in masses and move like an army from field to field so that seedbeds or the direct seeded fields look as if grazed by cattles. Generally, a transplanted crop is not severely affected. Damage by armyworms is most serious during periods of stem elongation and grain formation. Larvae defoliate plants, typically by chewing angular pieces off leaves. They may also feed on the panicle near the developing kernels causing these kernels to dry before filling. This feeding causes all or parts of the panicle to  turn white. If the entire panicle is white, the damage may also be due to stem rot or feeding by rats. The  seriousness of armyworm injury depends on the maturity of the plant and the amount of tissue consumed.

,"Breakdown is usually associated with the tendency of gelatinized starch granules to break during holding at high temperature, accompanied with continuous shearing (Han and Hamaker 2001). Breakdown is usually calculated from a resulting viscogram by subtracting trough from peak viscosity. The increase in rice flour breakdown viscosity, although not always significant (P < 0.05), suggests a greater protection of the starch granule integrity. This probably is due to the increased affinity of proteins to interact with starch, as a result of protein denaturation.

,"For rice: Straighthead is a physiological disorder that causes the entire head to be blank and remain upright at maturity in rice. Straighthead generally occurs in spots scattered throughout a field and is most easily recognized near harvest when normal plants have downturned heads (from the weight of the grain in the panicle). The disease is frequently found on sandy loam soils but seldom on clay soils. Old cotton fields with arsenic residues can have a severe incidence of straighthead. Other, as yet unknown, soil factors are also involved in causing straighthead. Often it is found in fields where excessive non-decayed vegetation has been plowed under just before planting. The disease is characterized by upright heads when the rice matures due to infertile seed. Hulls may be distorted into a crescent shape or ""parrot beak"". One or both hulls may be missing. Affected plants continue to grow, are a darker green, and often produce shoots from a lower portion of the plant. First year crops of rice grown on ""new ground"" are more likely to be affected. Some varieties are more tolerant than others. Control measures include planting resistant varieties and draining fields with a history of the disorder just prior to internode elongation.",,,"""Malformed inflorescence (panicle in rice), by staying upright/straight at the time of maturity and may carry infertile seeds.""
